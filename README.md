NED CISE
========

Website I developed for NED CIS. 
There were around 560 people who participated (4 year students and 2, 70 size batches for each year.)
I won the competition among them and my site got selected as the site to represent the department.

The site is live <a href="http://fahaduddin92.github.io/NED-University-of-Engineering-Technology-CISE-Department-s-website/index.html>here</a>.
